https://www.databricks.com/glossary/catalyst-optimizer
>At the core of Spark SQL is the Catalyst optimizer, which leverages advanced programming language features (e.g. Scala’s pattern matching and quasi quotes) in a novel way to build an extensible query optimizer. Catalyst is based on functional programming constructs in Scala and designed with these key two purposes:
> 1. Easily add new optimization techniques and features to Spark SQL
> 2. Enable external developers to extend the optimizer (e.g. adding data source specific rules, support for new data types, etc.)

>Tungsten is the codename for the umbrella project to make changes to Apache Spark’s execution engine that focuses on substantially improving the efficiency of memory and CPU for Spark applications, to push performance closer to the limits of modern hardware.
